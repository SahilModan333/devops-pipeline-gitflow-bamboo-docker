# devops-pipeline-gitflow-bamboo-docker
A straightforward and Simple DevOps pipeline showing how I manage code with Git Flow, automate builds with Bamboo, and package apps with Docker. It’s a real-life example of how I deliver and track software from development to deployment.


DevOps Pipeline Project

This repository contains a simple, real-life example of a DevOps pipeline I use to manage software delivery.

What it does:

Organizes code changes with Git Flow.

Automates build and deployment with Bamboo.

Packages applications into Docker containers.

Tracks code commits, builds, and deployments for full traceability.

Why it matters:

This pipeline helps deliver software faster, with fewer errors, and makes it easy to see what’s running where.

Technologies:

Git + Bitbucket

Bamboo CI/CD

Docker + Docker Hub

AWS

How to use:

Check the branches and Bamboo plans to see how code moves from development to production, and how Docker images are built and deployed.
